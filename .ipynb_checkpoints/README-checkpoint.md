Hello and welcome to our Dashboard project. Our role is data scientists who focus on HR consulting and target audience are company's Marketing Department, HR & Job Seekers who are seek for data scientist jobs. Nowadays companies are paying more and more attention to hiring. A good hiring strategy can significantly help reducing the cost on training and also have a return of a more appropriate selection among the candidates. Big Data is one of the most popular method that are used for hiring. One general method is that these companies will conduct some training courses to the candidates and hiring by combining the test result with the candidatesâ€™ basic information. Many people signup for their training. In our case, our company wants to know which of these candidates has higher probability passing the test then get the data scientist position after. This will help to reduce the cost and time as well as to increase quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment. From the company decision maker perspective, they would also like to know the distribution of the candidates (relationship between features of candidates) so that they can make future predictions that may be helpful in hiring suitable employees.
