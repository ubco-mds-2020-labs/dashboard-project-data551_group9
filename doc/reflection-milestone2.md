# Reflection

## What we have implemented:

At milestone2 stage, we have implemented four graphs into our hr-marketing-analytics project. Basically it suggests the way it is in our [milestone1](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/dashboard-project-data551_group9/releases/tag/v1.0) stage. The difference is that we split four graphs into two tabs. Audience can select the topic that they want to explore, either HR perspective or marketing perspective. 

- The first tab (HR perspective): title is given as "HR Analytics on Training". On the left hand side, there are two dropdown menus and one radio button menu. Users can select desired education levels and do comparisons by using the two dropdown menus. Users can select previous company size by using the radio button menu. These two graphs can help HR to explore the relationship between education level or previous company size, and training hours. 

- The second tab (Advertising perspective): title is given as "Advertising Analytics on Job Change". On the left hand side, there's a slider and a dropdown menu. Users can select desired city index range by using the slider. Users can select experience level by using the dropdown menu. The first graph on the right shows the relationship between city index and percentage of people who want to change their job, given their last job duration. The will help marketing department to allocate advertisement fees in cities with different development index. The second graph on the right will help marketing department to explore more in the question of which major and education level will have more people who want to switch their job. 

## Future implements and improvements:

At this stage, we only have a rough idea of what our dashboard going to look like. We still have a lot more work to do. Below points are futher implements or improvements we want to add in future milestone stages. 

- We still need to put more information in text. For example, introduction under each tabs, explanation of each dropdown/radio/slider menu, and explanation for each graph. Beside, we will also put in some hyper links for users to explore more information. 

- We are still discussing the importance of these four graphs, or maybe we can obtain more useful information than the four we have already implemented. As well, for the second graph on the right under advertising perspective tab, we are still trying to find a way to deal with those missing information. The problem is that we can just delete that part because it contains a lot information what we don't want to lose. We need to figure out a way to deal with this.

- The coding part also need to be improved. We will add more explanation in our coding part. We will try to seperate them into several "def" so that people who want to improve our dashboard can easily read our code.
