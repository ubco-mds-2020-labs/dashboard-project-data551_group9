# Team Contract

## A. Goals

- To do work that we are qualified and capable of doing.
- Operate in a proactive manner, anticipating potential problems and working to prevent them before they happen.
- Keep every team member informed.
- Work together through Google Doc to make sure works will be distributed in a fair and equitable way.
- Focus on what is best for the project as a whole, which means it will be acceptable for one team member to do more work than another under certain conditions.
- Expected working length would be two to three days for each lab to be completed.
- See the project through to completion.

## B. Meeting Norms

- Daily meeting and modification until each lab finished.
- No time restriction for each meeting, end daily meeting until we finished the part that we both agreed with from the begining of the meeting.
- Be honest and open during meetings.
- Encourage a diversity of opinions on all topics.
- Avoiding placing blame when things go wrong. We will discuss the process and explore how it can be improved.
- Let another team member be aware of any changes made as soon as possible.

## C. Work Norms

- Since lab 1 is hard to split jobs, we will work together on Google Doc and focus on what is best for the project.
- Quality of work are expected to satisfy the rubric, and to be verified by each group mumber.
- Listen openly to each other's points of view.
- Regard conflit as normal and as an opportunity to grow.
- When conflicts happened, choose an appropriate time place to discuss and explore the conflict, seek to find some common ground for agreement.
- Acknowledge valid points that the other person has made.
- When time conflict happened, seek to find other solutions through communication

## D. Decision Making

- Since we are working together at the same time for lab1 and only two of us in the group, concensus needed before making decision.
- Seek to find all needed information and data.
- Discuss criteria (cost, time, impact, ect.) for making a decision before choosing an option.
- Encourage and explore different interpretations of data.
- If one of us fixates on a particular idea, we can go for TA or Firas to ask for more opinion. And then seek to find agreement.
