__Our dashboard contains 4 analyzation in two tabs:__
- HR perspective: this tab share the method for figuring out the correlation between factors that are used to select candidates and training apply to candidates(aiming for optimizing/reducing training length).
1. Plot explores the relationship between education level and training hours
2. Plot discusses the difference between relevant experience and training hours
- Advertising perspective: this tab share the marketing method for applying for more targeted publication for specific group that have great probability be the protential job seeker.
1. Plot researches the distribution of job change ratio in different development level cities, among job candidates with different last job serving length
2. Plot probes the relationship between major discipline and education level among different experience candidates

__Parts we have not implemented:__
- Making more comparison between the candidates who would like to change job and who would not, this is also important for us to pick up the difference of candidates feature in these groups. Measuring the qualification is important, but we also need pay more attention to the group who would like to select our position as his/her next job. 
- Using an algorithm to calculate the comprehensive grader from each candidates(convert factors into a more quantifiaable level)and plot them, through which we are able to get a more direct conclusion from visual. This would be more convenient for recuitment decision maker to make decisions based on the quantification indicator.

The reason we did not implement on these above two aspects is that our dashboard focus on optimizing the training method to job candidates, for reducing the cost and searching for the most targeted group of candidates. Make comparison between groups that will or will not change job should be one further step and since our group only have 2 person, we focus on improving our current analysis. Also for the second non-implemented point, we actually need a valid algorithm to measure candidates basic information and then we can quantifize. And the verification of this algorithm require extra resource and may not be provided in this course. But this should be one important point for our future improvement
